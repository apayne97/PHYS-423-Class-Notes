% \begin{keynote}
% Goal : We’d like to be able to model the behavior of a particle, or series of particles (i.e. a protein) in water, to predict its behavior and understand its function.    
% \end{keynote}

% \subsection{Classical Mechanics and Predictability}

% A nice thing about 

% Non chaotic systems - error in initial conditions results in a predictable error in final prediction

% Some systems, even deterministic, classical ones, are “chaotic”.
% Double pendulum, 3-body problem
% History for Lorenz strange attractor, simple system of differential equations that lead to chaos

% < Experiment with Python code showing how a small error in initial conditions for a non chaotic system lead to predictable errors, whereas unpredictable errors in a chaotic system >
% Plot how the prediction error varies as a function of the error in the initial conditions for different kinds of systems

% Modeling a system of protein and water is similarly chaotic

% Early explorers in this field understood this experimentally as well (Einstein with diffusion, etc)
% Pollen in water - doesn’t act like a classical system, it’s getting “bumped”

% This was at a time when we weren’t sure that atoms existed yet!

% However, we already had the steam engine, ideal gas law, basic principles of entropy and thermodynamics - we just didn’t have a good model linking single particles to these bulk properties.

% The solution to this challenge? Statistics! Instead of trying to model the future position and momentum of a particular particle, we instead use a combination of statistics and mechanics to predict how the overall system of particles will behave. 

% In the next lecture we will discuss the foundational models for statiscal mechanics.

% Note about Randomness and Quantum Mechanics
% “Chaos” as we define it in chaos theory is different from the Copenhagen interpretation / Heisenberg uncertainty
