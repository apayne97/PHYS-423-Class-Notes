\chapter{Introduction}

Molecular Biophysics

\section{Core Ideas}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All models are wrong, some are useful.
    \item Form follows function
    \item Proteins are molecular machines
\end{itemize}

\section{Students should be able to...}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Identify several equations used in biophysics that derive from the Boltzmann equation
    \item Name several types of proteins, their functions, and why those functions are important for life
    \item Explain how the function of most proteins depends on their ability to sample different energetic states
    \item Use resources like Uniprot and the PDB to learn about proteins
    \item Download a protein structure from the PDB and visualize its key features

\end{itemize}

\section{Key Resources}

\begin{itemize}
    \item YouTube Lecture Series on Biophysics by Erik Lindahl \cite{lindahl_lecture_series}
    \item 3Blue1Brown Youtube Series, in particular the linear algebra series\cite{3b1b_linalg} and the calculus series\cite{3b1b_calc}
    \item Chemistry - the Central Science \cite{ccs_libretext}
\end{itemize}
