	abstract = {The spread of dengue (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) is a major public health concern. The primary target of antibodies that neutralize DENV and ZIKV is the envelope (E) glycoprotein, and there is interest in using soluble recombinant E (sRecE) proteins as subunit vaccines. However, the most potent neutralizing antibodies against DENV and ZIKV recognize epitopes on the virion surface that span two or more E proteins. Therefore, to create effective DENV and ZIKV vaccines, presentation of these quaternary epitopes may be necessary. The sRecE proteins from DENV and ZIKV crystallize as native-like dimers, but studies in solution suggest that these dimers are marginally stable. To better understand the challenges associated with creating stable sRecE dimers, we characterized the thermostability of sRecE proteins from ZIKV and three DENV serotypes, DENV2–4. All four proteins irreversibly unfolded at moderate temperatures (46–53 °C). At 23 °C and low micromolar concentrations, DENV2 and ZIKV were primarily dimeric, and DENV3–4 were primarily monomeric, whereas at 37 °C, all four proteins were predominantly monomeric. We further show that the dissociation constant for DENV2 dimerization is very temperature-sensitive, ranging from {\textless}1 μm at 25 °C to 50 μm at 41 °C, due to a large exothermic enthalpy of binding of −79 kcal/mol. We also found that quaternary epitope antibody binding to DENV2–4 and ZIKV sRecE is reduced at 37 °C. Our observation of reduced sRecE dimerization at physiological temperature highlights the need for stabilizing the dimer as part of its development as a subunit vaccine.},

	abstract = {Mutations in the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) rhodopsin are a common cause of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, a blinding disease. Rhodopsin self-associates in the membrane, and the purified monomeric apo-protein opsin dimerizes in vitro as it transitions from detergent micelles to reconstitute into a lipid bilayer. We previously reported that the retinitis pigmentosa-linked F220C opsin mutant fails to dimerize in vitro, reconstituting as a monomer. Using fluorescence-based assays and molecular dynamics simulations we now report that whereas wild-type and F220C opsin display distinct dimerization propensities in vitro as previously shown, they both dimerize in the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells. Unexpectedly, molecular dynamics simulations show that F220C opsin forms an energetically favored dimer in the membrane when compared with the wild-type protein. The conformation of the F220C dimer is unique, with transmembrane helices 5 and 6 splayed apart, promoting widening of the intracellular vestibule of each protomer and influx of water into the protein interior. FRET experiments with SNAP-tagged wild-type and F220C opsin expressed in HEK293 cells are consistent with this conformational difference. We speculate that the unusual mode of dimerization of F220C opsin in the membrane may have physiological consequences.},

	abstract = {Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a fatal pathogen that poses a serious health risk worldwide and especially in the middle east countries. Targeting the MERS-CoV 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) with small covalent inhibitors is a significant approach to inhibit replication of the virus. The present work includes generating a pharmacophore model based on the X-ray crystal structures of MERS-CoV 3CLpro in complex with two covalently bound inhibitors. In silico screening of covalent chemical database having 31,642 compounds led to the identification of 378 compounds that fulfils the pharmacophore queries. Lipinski rules of five were then applied to select only compounds with the best physiochemical properties for orally bioavailable drugs. 260 compounds were obtained and subjected to covalent docking-based virtual screening to determine their binding energy scores. The top three candidate compounds, which were shown to adapt similar binding modes as the reported covalent ligands were selected. The mechanism and stability of binding of these compounds were confirmed by 100 ns molecular dynamic simulation followed by MM/PBSA binding free energy calculation. The identified compounds can facilitate the rational design of novel covalent inhibitors of MERS-CoV 3CLpro enzyme as anti-MERS CoV drugs.},

Additionally, no antiviral drugs or vaccines were developed against the closely related coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV, despite previous zoonotic outbreaks. To identify starting points for such therapeutics, we performed a large-scale screen of electrophile and non-covalent fragments through a combined mass spectrometry and X-ray approach against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, one of two cysteine viral proteases essential for viral replication. Our crystallographic screen identified 71 hits that span the entire active site, as well as 3 hits at the dimer interface. These structures reveal routes to rapidly develop more potent inhibitors through merging of covalent and non-covalent fragment hits; one series of low-reactivity, tractable covalent fragments were progressed to discover improved binders. These combined hits offer unprecedented structural and reactivity information for on-going structure-based drug design against SARS-CoV-2 main protease.},

	abstract = {Relative alchemical binding free energy calculations are routinely used in drug discovery projects to optimize the affinity of small molecules for their drug targets. Alchemical methods can also be used to estimate the impact of amino acid mutations on protein:protein binding affinities, but these calculations can involve sampling challenges due to the complex networks of protein and water interactions frequently present in protein:protein interfaces. We investigate these challenges by extending a graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated open-source relative free energy calculation package (Perses) to predict the impact of amino acid mutations on protein:protein binding. Using the well-characterized model system barnase:barstar, we describe analyses for identifying and characterizing sampling problems in protein:protein relative free energy calculations. We find that mutations with sampling problems often involve charge-changes, and inadequate sampling can be attributed to slow degrees of freedom that are mutation-specific. We also explore the accuracy and efficiency of current state-of-the-art approaches─alchemical replica exchange and alchemical replica exchange with solute tempering─for overcoming relevant sampling problems. By employing sufficiently long simulations, we achieve accurate predictions (RMSE 1.61, 95\% CI: [1.12, 2.11] kcal/mol), with 86\% of estimates within 1 kcal/mol of the experimentally determined relative binding free energies and 100\% of predictions correctly classifying the sign of the changes in binding free energies. Ultimately, we provide a model workflow for applying protein mutation free energy calculations to protein:protein complexes, and importantly, catalog the sampling challenges associated with these types of alchemical transformations.

	abstract = {Inhibitors of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (Mpro) such as nirmatrelvir (NTV) and ensitrelvir (ETV) have proven effective in reducing the severity of COVID-19, but the presence of resistance-conferring mutations in sequenced viral genomes raises concerns about future drug resistance. Second-generation oral drugs that retain function against these mutants are thus urgently needed. We hypothesized that the covalent hepatitis C virus protease inhibitor boceprevir (BPV) could serve as the basis for orally bioavailable drugs that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro more efficiently than existing drugs. Performing structure-guided modifications of BPV, we developed a picomolar-affinity inhibitor, ML2006a4, with antiviral activity, oral pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic efficacy similar or superior to those of NTV. A crucial feature of ML2006a4 is a derivatization of the ketoamide reactive group that improves cell permeability and oral bioavailability. Last, ML2006a4 was found to be less sensitive to several mutations that cause resistance to NTV or ETV and occur in the natural SARS-CoV-2 population. Thus, anticipatory design can preemptively address potential resistance mechanisms to expand future treatment options against coronavirus variants.},

	abstract = {Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been extensively employed for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there is demand for discovering more SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors with diverse scaffolds to optimize anti-SARS-CoV-2 lead compounds. In this study, comprehensive in silico and in vitro assays were utilized to determine the potential inhibitors from TCM compounds against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, which is an important therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2. The ensemble docking analysis of 18263 TCM compounds against 15 SARS-CoV-2 Mpro conformations identified 19 TCM compounds as promising candidates. Further in vitro testing validated three compounds as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and showed IC50 values of 4.64 ± 0.11, 7.56 ± 0.78, and 11.16 ± 0.26 μM, with EC50 values of 12.25 ± 1.68, 15.58 ± 0.77, and 29.32 ± 1.25 μM, respectively. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicated that the three complexes remained stable over the last 100 ns of production run. An analysis of the binding mode revealed that the active compounds occupy different subsites (S1, S2, S3, and S4) of the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro via specific poses through noncovalent interactions with key amino acids (e.g., HIS 41, ASN 142, GLY 143, MET 165, GLU 166, or GLN 189). Overall, this study provides evidence indicating that the three natural products obtained from TCM could be further used for anti-COVID-19 research, justifying the investigation of Chinese herbal medicinal ingredients as bioactive constituents for therapeutic targets.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the ongoing risk of zoonotic transmission of coronaviruses to global health. To prepare for future pandemics, it is essential to develop effective antivirals targeting a broad range of coronaviruses. Targeting the essential and clinically validated coronavirus main protease (Mpro), we constructed a structurally diverse Mpro panel by clustering all known coronavirus sequences by Mpro active site sequence similarity. Through screening, we identified a potent covalent inhibitor that engaged the catalytic cysteine of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and used structure-based medicinal chemistry to develop compounds in the pyrazolopyrimidine sulfone series that exhibit submicromolar activity against multiple Mpro homologues. Additionally, we solved the first X-ray cocrystal structure of Mpro from the human-infecting OC43 coronavirus, providing insights into potency differences among compound–target pairs. Overall, the chemical compounds described in this study serve as starting points for the development of antivirals with broad-spectrum activity, enhancing our preparedness for emerging human-infecting coronaviruses.},

	abstract = {The heart, in addition to its primary role in blood circulation, functions as an endocrine organ by producing cardiac hormone natriuretic peptides. These hormones regulate blood pressure through the single-pass transmembrane receptor guanylyl cyclase A (GC-A), also known as natriuretic peptide receptor 1. The binding of the peptide hormones to the extracellular domain of the receptor activates the intracellular guanylyl cyclase domain of the receptor to produce the second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Despite their importance, the detailed architecture and domain interactions within full-length GC-A remain elusive. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures, functional analyses and molecular dynamics simulations of full-length human GC-A, in both the absence and the presence of atrial natriuretic peptide. The data reveal the architecture of full-length GC-A, highlighting the spatial arrangement of its various functional domains. This insight is crucial for understanding how different parts of the receptor interact and coordinate during activation. The study elucidates the molecular basis of how extracellular signals are transduced across the membrane to activate the intracellular guanylyl cyclase domain.},

	abstract = {Fragment hits serve as starting points for lead-like compound development. A common approach to advancing from fragments is to build structure-activity relationships (SARs) from close analogues. One strategy involves performing automated chemistry around fragment hits and evaluating resulting crude reaction mixtures (CRMs) of analogues in assays, bypassing costly purification. However, these purification-agnostic workflows are often perceived as noisy, and therefore typically involve additional hit resynthesis for confirmation, potentially discarding false negatives and reducing SAR dataset size. High-throughput (HT) X-ray crystallography has the potential to address these issues by unambiguously resolving hits directly from 100s–1000s of CRMs. However, no systematic analytics exist for extracting SAR models from HT crystallographic evaluation of CRMs. We demonstrate that crystallographic SAR (xSAR) can be extracted from CRMs evaluated via HT X-ray crystallography. We present here a simple rule-based ligand scoring scheme that identifies conserved chemical features linked to binding and non-binding observations in crystallography. Applied to a large-scale crystallographic dataset of 957 fragment elaborations in CRMs targeting PHIP(2), a therapeutically relevant bromodomain, our xSAR model demonstrated effectiveness in two proof-of-concept experiments. First, it recovered 26 missed binders in the initial dataset, doubling the hit rate and denoising the dataset. Second, it enabled a prospective virtual screen, also leveraging previously resolved cocrystal structures, that identified novel hits with informative chemistries, achieving up to a 10-fold binding affinity improvement over the repurified hit from the initial CRM evaluation. This work establishes a proof-of-concept that xSAR models can be directly extracted from large-scale crystallographic readouts of CRMs, offering a valuable methodology to build SAR models and accelerate design-make-test iterations without requiring CRM hit resynthesis and confirmation. This invites future work to utilise advanced analytics and modelling techniques to further strengthen purification-agnostic workflows.},
